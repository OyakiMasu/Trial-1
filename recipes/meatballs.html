<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
    <li>12 Grass-fed beef meatballs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Rice bran oil</li>
    <li>1 packet spaghetti or pasta of your choice</li>
    <li>4 tbsp Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>
 
<strong>Procedure</strong>

<ol>
<strong>Pasta Sauce:</strong>
    <li>On a medium heat, saut√© the garlic and onion with oil in a frying pan.
        Ensure that they become soft and almost translucent.</li>

    <li>Add the rest of the ingredients to your pan and simmer for another 5mins. After this, remove from the heat.</li>

<strong>Cooking and assembly:</strong>

    <li>Again, on a medium heat, use a large frying pan to heat the oil. Fry the meatballs in batches and use tongs to ensure that they are well-browned all over. Once your meatballs are cooked through, remove them from the heat.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook your pasta for 8-10 minutes (or for however long your packet instructs).</li>
    <li>During this time, heat up your sauce in a pan.</li>

<strong>  Serve:</strong>  

    <li>Place your pasta in bowls and top with your meatballs and sauce. Finish with shavings of parmesan.</li>

<strong> NOTES</strong>   

<strong> TIPS :</strong>

    <li>Add a little extra to this everyday dish to including some chilli and sundried tomatoes! Make sure you finish with some fresh herbs and extra parmesan for more indulgence!</li>
